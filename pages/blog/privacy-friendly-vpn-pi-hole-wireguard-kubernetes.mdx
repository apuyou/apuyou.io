[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) is great tool to protect your privacy by filtering requests at the DNS level. It was made to be set-up on a Raspberry Pi running in your home, but how can you stay protected when you're on the move?

In this article, we'll set up Pi-Hole to run in Kubernetes. We will also configure Wireguard so that you can connect securely to your Pi-Hole. This will encrypt all your traffic, not just DNS!

We assume that you already have a Kubernetes cluster running and that you are able to run `kubectl` commands from your environment.

# 1. Pi-Hole

Create the `pihole.yaml` file with the following contents. Head right after the file if you want some details on what it does!

```yaml

          image: pihole/pihole:latest
          env:
            - name: TZ
              value: 'Europe/Paris'
            - name: WEBPASSWORD

            - name: DNS2
              value: 'no'
          volumeMounts:
            - name: pihole-local-etc-volume
              mountPath: '/etc/pihole'
            - name: pihole-local-dnsmasq-volume
              mountPath: '/etc/dnsmasq.d'
      volumes:
        - name: pihole-local-etc-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pihole-etc-pv-claim
        - name: pihole-local-dnsmasq-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pihole-dnsmasq-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pihole
spec:
  selector:
    app: pihole
  clusterIP: 10.41.0.2
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      name: pihole-admin
    - port: 53
      targetPort: 53
      protocol: TCP
      name: dns-tcp
    - port: 53
      targetPort: 53
      protocol: UDP
      name: dns-udp
```

The first two sections create two 1GB volumes for PiHole data.

The third section is the deployment of Pi-Hole itself:

- the Docker image is `pihole/pihole:latest`. If you want to handle upgrades manually, you can replace this with a specific version such as `pihole/pihole:v5.2.1`.
- Environment variables allow you to customise some settings. You can see all available options [here](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#environment-variables). You should **at least change the password**.
- `/etc/pihole` and `/etc/dnsmasq.d` are mounted to the two persistent volumes we created previously. Dnsmasq is a DNS server used by Pi-Hole and its configuration needs to be persisted.

The last section is the service that will expose PiHole's web interface and DNS server to the Kubernetes network. We're setting the IP address to `10.41.0.2` but you can change this if you already have other services in your cluster.

To start this service, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pihole.yaml
```

# 2. WireGuard

Now that Pi-Hole is running, we want to be able to access it through a VPN.

Wireguard is a recent solution with great clients on multiple platforms.

## Download a client

On recent Ubuntu/Debian distributions, you can install WireGuard as a package:

```yaml
sudo apt install wireguard
```

On macOS or iOS, you can find great clients directly on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12).

## Generate a public & private key for the gateway

We need to generate a private key for the WireGuard peer that will be running inside Kubernetes. The public key can be derived from it.

If you are on Linux, you can use the following command:

```yaml
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

This will generate two files with pretty clear names.

If you're on macOS, you can click on the WireGuard icon > _Manage Tunnels_ > _+_ > _Add Empty Tunnel…_

![Generating a Private Key on macOS](macos-key.png)

You can copy the Private key and Public key fields to a file then click _Discard_. We need these values to configure the server but do not need to store them on your Mac.

## Create the client configuration

We will also need a private/public key pair for the client, so let's generate it right now. You can use the same steps as previously, just keep them in a separate files.

## Deploy WireGuard

We'll proceed the same way as previously and create a `wireguard.yaml` configuration file for this new deployment.

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: wg-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  privatekey: <Gateway Private Key>

    PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

            - echo "Public key '$(wg pubkey < /etc/wireguard/privatekey)'" && /entrypoint.sh

```

The first section defines a secret which will be handled by Kubernetes. You should replace the private key with the one you generated earlier for the gateway.

The second section is the WireGuard configuration for the gateway peer. You need to replace the Public Key for the client. Note that the IP address for your client is specified manually.

If you want to add other clients later, you will need to generate a private/public key for them, define their IP address and add a new `[Peer]` section in the gateway configuration.

The third section is the deployment itself. A few notes here:

- An _initContainer_ is used to change some network settings on the host. Also, the WireGuard container itself will have some high privileges in order to manipulate network interfaces. You should take this in consideration if your Kubernetes cluster has some other services running on it.
- Configuration files and private key are retrieved from the previously defined sections.

Finally, a service is defined so that your WireGuard deployment is accessible. The ClusterIP allows it to be able to talk with the Pi-Hole deployment. The _nodePort_ allows the service to be accessible directly through the node's public IP.

Once again, you can start the service with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pihole.yaml
```

## Create client configuration

Now that your gateway is ready, you can configure your client.

If you are using the CLI, you should create the following file in `/etc/wg0.conf`. With GUI clients, you can just copy/paste it in the settings.

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Client Private Key>
Address = 10.41.1.2/32
DNS = 10.41.0.2
MTU = 1370

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Gateway Public Key>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = server.example.com:32154
```

Interface defines the client-side configuration. The _Address_ is the IP Address assigned manually to your client. The _PrivateKey_ is specific to this client and should match the _PublicKey_ set in the server configuration. The _DNS_ setting tells WireGuard to send DNS queries to the Pi-Hole.

_Peer_ defines the gateway that the client will connect to. Add the Gateway _PublicKey_ here and replace its hostname and port so that your client can find it. _AllowedIPs_ defines which IP addresses will be routed through the VPN. You have two options here:

- If you want all traffic to be encrypted, keep `0.0.0.0/0`. This is much safer but also means that your connection will depend on your gateway's bandwidth. This may also be more expensive if you are paying for traffic on the gateway side (this is often the case on Cloud environments).
- If you only want DNS requests to be sent through the VPN, set this value to `10.41.1.0/24`: this is Pi-Hole's IP Address.

You can now connect the tunnel using the buttons from your graphical client or by running:

```
wg-quick wg0 up
```

Once the VPN is up, you can view the Pi-Hole dashboard at [http://10.41.0.2/admin/](http://10.41.0.2/admin/).
